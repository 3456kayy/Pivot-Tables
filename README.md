<h1>Pivot Tables</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the creation of a pivot table to analyze monthly expenses across categories such as groceries, cosmetic health, and entertainment. Excelâ€™s PivotTable functionality was used to consolidate data, summarize actual costs, benchmark budgets, and highlight discrepancies between spending and predefined budgets. Other Excel tools, like slicers were used to filter and visualize data interactively, providing deeper insights into financial trends. The analysis highlighted areas where expenses exceeded the predefined budget, such as in the cosmetic health category, offering a starting point for improving spending habits. This project showcases expertise in using Excel for data organization, financial analysis, and interactive reporting, offering critical analysis for budget control and future decision-making.
